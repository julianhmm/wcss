   - Right-click on `Abfuhrtermine (iCal) herunterladen` and copy link address.
   - Replace the `url` in the example configuration with this link.
   - The trailing part of the URL is a URL-encoded JSON string. It contains the "from" and "to" dates for the calendar. You need to replace the "from" date with `01.01.{%Y}` and the "to" date with `31.12.{%Y}`. You can use a ureldecoding/-encoding service to make the URL path easier to edit.
