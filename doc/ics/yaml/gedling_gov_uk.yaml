   - Gedling Borough Council does not provide bin collections in the iCal calendar format directly.
   - The iCal calendar files have been generated from the official printed calendars and hosted on GitHub for use.
   - Go to: https://apps.gedling.gov.uk/refuse/search.aspx and enter your street name to find your bin day/garden waste collection schedule. e.g. "Wednesday G2".
   - Select the requried .ics calendar from the folder https://github.com/jamesmacwhite/gedling-borough-council-bin-calendars/tree/main/ical, for the URL, make sure to use the "Raw" button which is the direct URL to the calendar. The URL should start with "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/".
