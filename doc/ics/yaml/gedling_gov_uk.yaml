   - Gedling Borough Council does not provide bin collections in the iCal calendar format directly.
   - The iCal calendar files have been generated from the official printed calendars and hosted on GitHub for use.
   - Go to the Gedling Borough Council [Refuse Collection Days](https://apps.gedling.gov.uk/refuse/search.aspx) site and enter your street name to find your bin day/garden waste collection schedule. e.g. "Wednesday G2".
   - Find the [required collection schedule](https://jamesmacwhite.github.io/gedling-borough-council-bin-calendars/) and use the "Copy to clipboard" button for the URL of the .ics file.
