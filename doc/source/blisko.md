Support for schedules provided by [Blisko](https://blisko.co/).

Blisko app supports mutliple voivodeships and cities. 
Each voivodeships has its own `ownerId` - an ID that Blisko assigns to a city/voivodeships. 

Unfortunately there is no easy was to figure out necessary arguments; those can be figured out by:
* Inspecting via Web Developer tools a web page that your local government provides with waste collection schedule. For instance my local government host the schedule [here](https://dobraszczecinska.pl/wiadomosc/gospodarka-odpadami-w-gminie-dobra).
* If there is no web page available one can use [MITM proxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) and eavesdropping Blisko App communication with the server. 

## Configuration via configuration.yaml
