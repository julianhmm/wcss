# UK Bin Collection Data (UKBCD)

The [UK Bin Collection Data project](https://github.com/robbrad/UKBinCollectionData) provides waste collection schedules in a standardised json format for a number of UK councils.
There is significant overlap with the UK councils supported by HACS Waste Collection Schedule project. 

If you're using UKBCD to generate a json file containing your collection schedule, that file can function as a HACS Waste Collection Schedule source.

## Configuration via configuration.yaml

```yaml
waste_collection_schedule:
    sources:
    - name: ukbcd
      args:
        file: FILE
```

### Configuration Variables

**file**  
*(string) (optional)*

Local json file name. Care should be taken to ensure the correct path and filename is used.

## Example

```yaml
# file location: config/www/bin_schedule.json
waste_collection_schedule:
  sources:
    - name: ukbcd
      args:
        file: "www/bin_schedule.json"
```

### Notes
Usage questions and issues relating to [UKBCD](https://github.com/robbrad/UKBinCollectionData) should be directed to that project. The HACS Waste Collection Schedule simply parses json files generated by any UKBCD scripts you may be running.
