# South Norfolk and Broadland Council

Support for schedules provided by [South Norfolk and Broadland Council](https://www.southnorfolkandbroadland.gov.uk/rubbish/find-bin-collection-day)

## Configuration via configuration.yaml

```yaml
waste_collection_schedule:
  sources:
    - name: south_norfolk_and_broadland_gov_uk
      args:
        address_payload: ADDRESS_PAYLOAD
```

Full examples for both council areas are given at the bottom of the documentation.

### Configuration Variables

**postcode**  
*(String) (optional)  

**address**  
*(String) (optional)  

**address_payload**  
*(dict) (optional) (depricated)*  

Either address_payload or postcode and address are needed (using address_payload if both are present)

## Get the arguments

### postcode and address

- Go to <https://area.southnorfolkandbroadland.gov.uk/FindAddress>.
- Enter your postcode and also use it as postcode variable.
- Select your address and use it as address variable. The string should exactly match the text of the selectable address.

### address_payload (depricated)

This is the only configuration variable and is required. It is very easy to fetch by capturing the data from a cookie using Google Chrome or a Chromium-based browser. (This method does not work in Firefox or Safari).
1. Go to https://area.southnorfolkandbroadland.gov.uk/
2. Input your postcode and select your address
3. Paste the following code snippet into your browser console (right click -> inspect element -> console)
4. Paste the result into your `configuration.yaml`

```js
cookieStore.get("MyArea.Data")
    .then(({ value }) => value)
    .then(decodeURIComponent)
    .then(JSON.parse)
    .then((value) => JSON.stringify(value, null, 2))
    .then(console.log)
    .catch(console.error);
```
