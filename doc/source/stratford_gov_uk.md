## How to find your `UPRN`

An easy way to find your Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) is by going to <https://www.findmyaddress.co.uk/> and entering in your address details.

Otherwise you can use the Inspect tool after typing your address on Stratford-on-Avon's [When We Collect](https://www.stratford.gov.uk/waste-recycling/when-we-collect.cfm) page.

Simply search for your address with the Inspect tool set to view Network requests, look for the POST request and view its payload. You're looking for `frmUPRN=`.
