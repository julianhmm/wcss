This directory contains a partial Java port of the Python based `waste_collection_schedule` integration.

The Java version demonstrates basic data structures and a very small ICS parser. It is **not** a full rewrite but can be used as a starting point for further work.

Usage example can be found in `src/Main.java` which parses two events from an in-memory ICS string.
